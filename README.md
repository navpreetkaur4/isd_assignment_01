## Assignment
### Assignment 1: Bank Account and Client Management System
In this assignment, you created a basic bank account management system. The system included a **BankAccount** class and a **Client** class. The **BankAccount** class managed attributes such as balance, account type, and transactions, while the **Client** class managed customer details like name, address, and account associations.

### Assignment 2: Enhancing the Bank Account System
In this assignment, you expanded upon the initial bank account system by adding more functionality. You introduced the ability to handle multiple bank accounts per client and refined the system to manage different types of bank accounts (e.g., chequing, savings). Additionally, you wrote unit tests for the classes to ensure their correct behavior.

### Assignment 3: Advanced Bank Account Features and GUI Development
This assignment focused on developing advanced features for the bank account system and integrating a graphical user interface (GUI). You implemented features such as overdraft limits, interest calculations, and automated service charges for different account types. A simple GUI was created to allow users to interact with the system, adding and managing accounts easily.

### Assignment 4: Incorporating Filtering Algorithm, Documentation, and Distribution
In this assignment, you focused on further improving the bank account system by implementing a **filtering algorithm** that allowed users to filter bank accounts based on specific criteria. You also generated **HTML documentation** for the classes based on the docstrings written throughout the semester. Finally, the project was packaged using **Inno Setup**, allowing the system to be distributed to end users as an installer file.

### Assignment 5: Algorithms, Documentation, and Distribution
In this assignment, the focus is on improving the user interface of the bank account application by incorporating a **filtering algorithm** that enables users to filter bank account listings based on user-defined criteria. Additionally, this assignment requires the creation of **HTML help files** generated from the docstrings that have been coded throughout the project. The project will be packaged into a user-friendly **installer** to facilitate distribution to end users.

Key objectives of Assignment 5:
- Implement a filtering algorithm for bank account data.
- Generate HTML documentation for all classes using docstrings.
- Package the application using Inno Setup for easy distribution.

## Filtering
Filtering in the PiXELL-River Account Manager allows users to easily view specific data by narrowing down accounts and transactions based on criteria like account type, balance range, transaction type, and date.

Users can apply filters using dropdowns, date pickers, and search bars for quick and efficient results. This feature enhances user experience by allowing real-time updates and easy navigation through large datasets.

Filtering is implemented using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions to ensure smooth performance.
